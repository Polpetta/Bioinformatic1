\section{NGS}

It's a different approach to Sanger.
To prepare a NGS librariesc you need to have DNA fragments and some afapters,
and you need to attch Adapters to DNA fragments.

NGS doesn't use cloning in bacteria, but use PCR - Colonies (Polonies), so DNA
is not mixed. To do this, NGS use \textit{emulsion PCR}. The idea is like put
water and oil together.
Another method is the \textit{bridge PCR}.

NGS doesn't need electrophoresis, but it use istead the Pyrosequencing, that
use ATP and Luciferase, by the way Illumina chemistry is today the most used
method.
