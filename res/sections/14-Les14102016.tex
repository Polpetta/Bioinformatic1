\section{Alignment of amino acid sequences}
How can we align sequences?
We require algorithms able to find the best alignment between two sequences,
allowing gaps and mismatches.
Problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We need a objective function to establish exactly what we want to obtain
  \item We need an algorithm to find the best alignment, that is the alignment
that returns the highest score with the objective function. Alternatively, an
algorithm to find an alignment that approximate in the best possible way the
best alignment.
\end{itemize}
