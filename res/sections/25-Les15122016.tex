\section{RNA-Seq}
RNA-Seq is cheaper than GEN-Seq


If I want to find differences between different genoms I need to have a good 
gene prediction. After this, we can merge the gene prediction with the sam file 
(the position of the reads).

When we load the sequencer, we don't have the same quantity of a genome, you 
have to normalize it, and also you don't have all reads aligned. The 
normalization helps to have something more comparable.

Steps to do:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Align the genome
	\item Produce a table of reads
	\item Read the counts from a file
	\item Filtering
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problems}
95\% RNA is ribosomal RNA. There are methods to remove then, but they're not 
perfect.
