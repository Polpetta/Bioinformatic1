\section{Gene prediction and annotation}
A DNA starts with a prime (5' or 3' UTR) and has a start codon (ATG) and it 
finish with a stop codon.

\subsection{Gene prediction}
With the Markov Chain you can predict the next base after a sequence. In this 
way you can have a probabilistic approach to the 
problem.\footnote{\url{http://projects.haykranen.nl/markov/demo/}}
