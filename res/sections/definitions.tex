\section{Useful definitions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Diploid cells} contain two complete sets (2n) of
chromosomes
	\item \textbf{Haploid cells} have half the number of chromosomes
(n) as diploid/they contain only one complete set of chromosomes
	\item \textbf{mRNA} (messenger RNA) contains the informations to encode
proteins for the translation process
	\item An \textbf{Allele} is the variant form of a given gene
	\item \textbf{Meiosis} is a specialized type of cell division that
reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each
genetically distinct from the parent cell. Meiosis occurs in all sexually
reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes
	\item \textbf{Introns and exons} are parts of genes.
Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are converted into
mRNA
	\item \textbf{Transcription} is the process by which DNA is used as a
template to create mRNA
