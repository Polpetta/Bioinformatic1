\subsection{Micro-array technology}

A micro-array consists in a matrix of many micro probes fixed on a solid 
substrate.
The cDNA is labeled with a color. With this experiment in less than one day you 
can know all the expression of the DNA.

This is useful in order to compare two different DNA of the same gene.
But how can you compare different level of expression? You can just use 
euclidean distance the measure the distance.

\subsubsection{Unsupervised clustering}
Unsupervised means that you just want to compare the expression to see 
differences.

\subsubsection{RNA Seq}
This is a new technology that during the years surpassed the Micro-array 
technology.
