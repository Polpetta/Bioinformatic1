\section{Genetic and Physical mapping}

\subsection{N50 statistic}
N50 are metrics to measure the extent of the assembly. A contig N50 is 
calculated by first ordering every contig by length from longest to shortest.

50 mean that 50\% of the genome is assembled into contigs that are at least N50 
bases long. The weakness of this method is that i need to know also how 
accurate is the genome.

\subsection{Genetic maps}
Between generation we have crossing over of genetic code because we are diploid.

CentiMorgan is a unit of genetic distance that represents a 1\% probability of 
recombination during meiosis. The maximum value is 50\%.

\subsection{Binning: other methods for placing landmarks on a genome}

You merge a human cell with a mouse cell to pick up only cells with only one 
chromosome through \textit{PCR}.

We need to map the genes in the chromosomes.
